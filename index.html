            <p>
                Cristian Gomez was born in Houston, TX July 12, 1990. Since he was little, he was fascinated on working
                with
                computers and wanted to learn more. He took the time and decided to start coding to become knowledgable
                not just in helping people
                but in changing the world with technology.
